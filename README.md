This is a personal web development project. All of the code was written in plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS, _no frameworks were used_.<br>
All the media was designed and hand-crafted by **me**.<br>
<br>
The company **Bountiful Foods** is based in Carlsbad, California. They specialize in selling organic foods and drinks. Their company grows throughout the California coast, where there are numerous food trucks and small businesses.<br>
They serve a large number of clients, and their clientele is expanding daily.<br>

The contents of each page of the website are described in detail here, along with the techniques I employed and the skills they showcase.
