This is a personal web development project. All of the code was written in plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS, _no frameworks were used_.<br>
All the media was designed and hand-crafted by **me**.<br>
<br>
The company Bountiful Foods is based in Carlsbad, California. They specialize in selling organic foods and drinks. Their company grows throughout the California coast, where there are numerous food trucks and small businesses.<br>
They serve a large number of clients, and their clientele is expanding daily.<br>

* `The call-to-action section` encourages users to explore the "_Fresh_" page, highlighting my understanding of user engagement techniques. The use of responsive images and the "_Build my drink!_" button demonstrate my knowledge in interactive design principles.<br>
* `The "You already built X drinks" section` hints interactivity driven by JavaScript. This showcases my ability to incorporate dynamic content, store and manage using Localstorage user interactions.<br>
* `The weather section` likely utilizes JavaScript to fetch data from a weather API, displaying real-time weather information for Carlsbad. This demonstrates my proficiency in integrating third-party APIs, manipulating JSON data, and presenting it in a user-friendly manner.<br>

* `The main content` area, structured as a form, showcases my ability to design user interactions. The form's use of different input types (text, email, tel, textarea) demonstrates my familiarity with form elements and attributes.<br>
* `The ingredient section` demonstrate dynamic behavior using _select_, and the instructions _textarea_ that suggests interactivity driven by JavaScript and request from an API. This underlines my skills in creating dynamic user interfaces and handling user inputs.<br>
* `The form` is designed properly, using intuitive visual effects for required fields, dividing each section into areas for better style, and following to best practices in form-filling. The button itself expresses the form's intent; it is not just a "submit" button.<br>
* `Nutriotional facts` is displayed after entering all the necessary information. Depending on the fruits the user chose for the drink, the table will calculate various nutritional stats, showcasing my proficiency with calculations and the user-friendly presentation of information.<br>
